                        <li><strong>(a)</strong> Foreign Exchange and Contracts for Difference with GKFX Financial Services Ltd are all margin traded products. Therefore they inherently carry a high level of risk compared to other investments and as such you could lose more than your initial investment. They are all legally enforceable under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(b)</strong> Margined trades are trades on the price movement of a product. They settle based on the difference between the opening price and the closing price of the trade. They can settle in a currency other than your base currency and therefore your profit or loss could be liable to foreign exchange fluctuations.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(c)</strong> You should not trade any margined product unless you fully understand all the risks involved with doing so and that you have 	sufficient resources available to you that in the event, however unlikely you may deem it to be, that there is an adverse movement in the price of that product that you can meet the financial obligations required by you with respect to margin payments and losses.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(d)</strong> Margin trading is leveraged trading that allows ‘gearing’ which means that you can place a large trade by only putting up a small amount of money as margin. If the price moves in your favour you can greatly increase your profits. However even a small movement in price against you can lead to substantial losses and you may be required to deposit additional margin with us immediately to keep these trades open. You are liable for this and for any losses that may occur if your positions are closed. The potential losses, or profits, for margin traded products are unlimited and this should always be considered by you when making trading decisions.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(e)</strong> Not all trades can be opened or closed 24 hours a day. Many are subject to strict opening and closing times which can fluctuate. These are posted on our Market Information Sheets (MIS) which are available online and which we endeavour to keep up to date, without any obligation or liability on us to do so, or for its accuracy. For example national holidays and Daylight savings changes will affect the times when you can trade. Also a market may be suspended for a variety of reasons and during this time you will not usually be able to trade.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(f)</strong> You are placing trades on our prices and not those on an exchange. Depending on the market, our prices will usually be based on an exchange price but can fluctuate away from the underlying prices due to a variety of reasons. All open trades can only be closed and settled with us.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(g)</strong> Client funds are held by us and are segregated but we reserve the right to utilise some or all of those funds up to the level that the client is using to fund open positions. All client funds are subject to the Client Money Rules of the FSA, unless stated otherwise, and are guaranteed by them under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to a maximum of £48,000 (The first £30,000 of eligible claims is paid in full, and then 90% of the balance after that up to the maximum. This is changing from 1st January 2010 to a simple £50,000 maximum.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(h)</strong> If you are in any doubt whatsoever about any aspect of the risks involved in FX or CFD’s then we recommend that you seek 	 independent professional help or advice before continuing.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(i)</strong> If you are considering trading in shares in a company that you work for then you should seek legal advice beforehand to ascertain that you are not in breach of any regulations.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>(j)</strong> Margin trading is not necessarily designed to replace existing or traditional methods of investing and is therefore not suited to everyone.</li>
